I Have no idea what should go here. 

I'm impressed with the Netlify Visual Editor CLI. 

I think anything that's not too sensitive can actually go here! 

I came across Netlify long back but couldn't care less to explore anything here; Until.. my friend came to me for suggestion to deploy some HTML online. I have no idea of Netlify's pricing policy but following the steps helped me spin up this blog real quick. I'm going to wrap this up with this one single post and call it a day.
